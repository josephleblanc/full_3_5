# full_3_5
An implementation of a 3.5 dnd rule set using rust and bevy

The goal of this project is to make a game which uses all of the open game license content available on d20pfsrd.

Currently the project is in its very early stages, and character creation is the main focus of development. This involves setting up the framework of a lot of other systems, because the process of character creation touches on many aspects of the game.

This game is built in bevy, and the intention behind its design is to incorporate as many ECS-oriented (Entity-Component-System) principles as possible.
